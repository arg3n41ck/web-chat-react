This project is a video chat web application developed using React, NodeJS, ExpressJS and Socket.IO technologies. The web application allows users to communicate with each other in real time via video chat.

The frontend of the application uses the React library, which provides a fast and efficient user interface display.

The server side of the application is developed in NodeJS using the ExpressJS framework for handling HTTP requests and routing. The Socket.IO library is also used to provide two-way communication between the client and the server and real-time data transmission.

This project demonstrates how modern technology can be used to create real-time web applications.
